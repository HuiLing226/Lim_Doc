# Chapter 0: Introduction â€” Arduino Portenta H7

The **Arduino Portenta H7** is a high-performance development board designed for **AI, IoT, and edge computing** applications.  

Its main processor is the **dual-core STM32H747**, which includes:  
- **CortexÂ® M7** running at **480 MHz**  
- **CortexÂ® M4** running at **240 MHz**  

The two cores communicate via a **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** mechanism, which allows one core to call functions on the other seamlessly. Both processors share all in-chip peripherals and can run independently or cooperatively.
