# Chapter 0: Introduction â€” Arduino Portenta H7

The **Arduino Portenta H7** is a powerful development board designed for **AI, IoT, and edge computing applications**.  
Its main processor is the **dual-core STM32H747**, which includes:  

- **CortexÂ® M7** running at **480 MHz**  
- **CortexÂ® M4** running at **240 MHz**  

The two cores communicate via a **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism** that allows seamless function calls across processors. Both processors share all the in-chip peripherals and can run:  

- Arduino sketches on top of the **ArmÂ® Mbedâ„¢ OS**  
- Native **Mbedâ„¢ applications**  
- **MicroPython / JavaScript** via interpreter  
- **TensorFlowâ„¢ Lite** for on-device AI
