### Pinout and Board Layout 

The **NUCLEO-F446RE** are designed with **dual pinout compatibility**:

1. **Arduino™ Uno R3 headers (female pin sockets)**  
   - Allow direct plug-in of Arduino shields.  
   - Pins are arranged as **D0–D15** (digital) and **A0–A5** (analog).  

2. **ST morpho headers (male pin headers, CN7 & CN10)**  
   - Provide **full access to nearly all STM32 pins**.  
   - Enable advanced use cases beyond Arduino compatibility.

## Chap 01: Install STM32 and Get Started

### 1. Install STM32CubeIDE
1. Download STM32CubeIDE from: [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).  
2. Install on your system (Windows, Linux, or macOS).  
3. Launch the IDE.

### 2. Setup a New Project
1. Open **STM32CubeIDE**.  
2. Go to **File > New > STM32 Project**.  
3. In the MCU/Board selector:  
   - Search for **NUCLEO-F446RE** or **STM32F446RE**.  
4. Select the board and click **Next**.  
5. Name your project (e.g., `led_blink_test`).  
6. Finish and let CubeIDE generate the project files.

### 3. Configure Clock & Peripherals
- By default, NUCLEO-F446RE uses **HSE oscillator (8 MHz)** and can be configured up to **180 MHz** with PLL.  
- For basic LED blink test, no special clock configuration is required.  

### 4. Compile and Run Project
1. Connect NUCLEO-F446RE via USB.  
2. Select **Run > Debug** in CubeIDE.  
3. IDE will flash the program onto the board using the built-in ST-LINK debugger.  
4. The board will reset and run the program.
