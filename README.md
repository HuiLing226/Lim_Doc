### Pinout and Board Layout 

The **NUCLEO-F446RE** are designed with **dual pinout compatibility**:

1. **Arduinoâ„¢ Uno R3 headers (female pin sockets)**  
   - Allow direct plug-in of Arduino shields.  
   - Pins are arranged as **D0â€“D15** (digital) and **A0â€“A5** (analog).

2. **ST morpho headers (male pin headers, CN7 & CN10)**  
   - Provide **full access to nearly all STM32 pins**.  
   - Enable advanced use cases beyond Arduino compatibility.

## Chap 01: Install STM32 and Get Started

### 1. Install STM32CubeIDE
1. Download STM32CubeIDE from: [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).  
2. Install on your system (Windows, Linux, or macOS).  
3. Launch the IDE.

### 2. Setup a New Project
1. Open **STM32CubeIDE**.  
2. Go to **File > New > STM32 Project**.  
3. In the MCU/Board selector:  
   - Search for **STM32F446RET6**.  
4. Select the board and click **Next**.  
5. Name your project.  
6. Finish and let CubeIDE generate the project files.

## Chap 02: First Program â€“ Blink the LED

### 1. Configure Pin in STM32CubeIDE
1. In the **.ioc file**, go to **Pinout & Configuration**.  
2. Select pin **PA5** and set it as **GPIO_Output**.  
  - On the NUCLEO-F446RE board, the **LD2 (user LED)** is connected to **PA5**.
  - Reference: [NUCLEO-F446RE Schematic Diagram](https://github.com/HuiLing226/Lim_Doc/blob/main/NUCLEO_F446RE_SCHEMATICS.pdf)
3. CubeIDE will automatically add it under `GPIO`.  

### 2. Generate Code
- Select **Project > Generate Code** (or press **Alt+K**).  
- CubeIDE will generate `main.c` file along with the necessary HAL drivers.

### 3. Write Code in `main.c`in under while loop
Inside the **while loop**, add the following code:

```
while (1)
  {
    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5);  // Toggle LED on PA5
    HAL_Delay(500);                         // Delay 500 ms
  }
}
```

### 4. Build and Flash the program
1. Go to **Project > Build Project** to compile the code.
2. Connect the NUCLEO-F446RE board via USB.
3. Select **Run > Run As > STM32 C/C++ Application**.
4. The LED (LD2) on pin **PA5** will start blinking at 1 Hz (on/off every 500 ms).

## Chap 03: Microphone Selection  

For STM32 audio projects, there are mainly **two categories** of microphones to consider:  

### 1. Analog Microphones  
#### How they work:  
- Convert acoustic pressure waves into a continuous electrical signal (voltage waveform).  
- STM32 requires an **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** to digitize the signal.

### 2. Digital Microphones  
#### How they work:  
- Convert sound directly into a **digital signal** before transmission.  
- Common output formats:  
  - **PDM (Pulse Density Modulation)** â†’ supported on STM32 with libraries.  
  - **IÂ²S (Inter-IC Sound)** â†’ common and natively supported by STM32 peripherals.  


For this project, we select the **SPH0645LM4H-B** digital MEMS(Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems) microphone.  

- **Interface:** IÂ²S â†’ compatible with STM32 Nucleo-64 boards  
- **Frequency Response:** 50 Hz â€“ 15 kHz  â†’ Suitable for **bird calls (1 â€“ 8 kHz)**.    
- **Voltage Supply:** 1.6 â€“ 3.6 V â†’ works with Nucleo-64â€™s 3.3 V supply.  
- **Power Consumption:** Low, suitable for continuous outdoor monitoring.  

#### Advantages:  
- No need for ADC â†’ direct IÂ²S connection to STM32.  
- Compact and robust MEMS design.  
- High sensitivity and reliability for use.
- Optimized for high-performance applications such as AI/ML audio processing.
