# Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART)

## Chapter 1: Introduction and Setup
### What is UART?
- A hardware communication peripheral used for serial data exchange.  
- It supports both **synchronous** (with clock) and **asynchronous** (without clock) communication.  
- In most microcontroller-to-PC applications, we use **asynchronous mode**, commonly referred to as UART.  
- It is widely used for debugging and communication between microcontrollers and PCs.
